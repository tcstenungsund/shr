The Metatag module allows you to automatically provide structured metadata, aka "meta tags",
about a website. In the context of search engine optimization, when people refer to meta tags 
they are usually referring to the meta description tag and the meta keywords tag that may help 
improve the rankings and display of a site in search engine results.

The Pathauto module automatically generates URL/path aliases for various kinds of content (nodes, taxonomy 
terms, users) without requiring the user to manually specify the path alias. This allows you to have URL 
aliases like /category/my-node-title instead of /node/123. The aliases are based upon a "pattern" system 
that uses tokens which the administrator can change.

your site) to transform it into a drop-down menu, providing a fast access to all administration pages.

all the toolbar functionalities (shortcut / media responsive).
